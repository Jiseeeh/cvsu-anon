# CvSU Anon

> :bulb: Note
> If you encounter infinite loading, it's likely that the deployment has become inactive. Render free tier spins down the instance after 15 minutes of inactivity, so I need to visit the dashboard to reactivate it (BUT ITS TEDIOUS) Setting up a cron job to visit it every 14 minutes would do (I believe) but making one on render requires a card

CvSU Anon is a web application inspired by NGL. In this application, you earn points (called 'ray points') as you send and receive messages and it features a leaderboard to show who has the most RP among the users.
